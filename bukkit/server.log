2012-04-03 10:03:14 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> all the "roof" blocks do not have sunlight[0m

2012-04-03 10:06:32 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> so either you have to have a block surrounded by doors, and a ton of them, but all several[0m

2012-04-03 10:07:53 [INFO] <lluoc> ?[0m
2012-04-03 10:08:03 [INFO] <lluoc> how many 'houses' do you have?[0m
2012-04-03 10:08:27 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> provided there are 16 adult Villagers and at least 21 houses (counted as doors). An Iron Golem will[0m
2012-04-03 10:08:38 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> lem will also spawn in non generated villages. The chance of spawning is 1 in 7000 per tick.[0m
2012-04-03 10:09:04 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> in my village, each of those doors counts as a house....so uh....approximately a fuckton[0m
2012-04-03 10:09:22 [INFO] <lluoc> so how many golems do you have?[0m
2012-04-03 10:09:28 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> but I also need 16 adult villagers PER golem[0m
2012-04-03 10:09:38 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> I rarely have one golem, in the entire town[0m
2012-04-03 10:09:47 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> before I kill the bastard for loots[0m

2012-04-03 10:10:31 [INFO] <lluoc> And I've noticed the villages all go to a small secion of 'rooms'[0m
2012-04-03 10:10:33 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> dunno, they keep dissapearing. More than 16 for sure[0m
2012-04-03 10:10:45 [INFO] <lluoc> the problem might be in their choosing algorithm[0m
2012-04-03 10:10:48 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> they just go to the nearest "room" at darkness[0m
2012-04-03 10:11:06 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> plus they're going for a bunch of those rooms[0m
2012-04-03 10:11:14 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> it just turns out they're all in the same place anyway[0m
2012-04-03 10:11:29 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> I think the mass of doors recentralised the town centre to that sector of the doors[0m
2012-04-03 10:11:39 [INFO] <lluoc> heh[0m
2012-04-03 10:11:46 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> because the iron golems spawn at the centre of town, and they seem to spawn around the doors[0m
2012-04-03 10:11:48 [INFO] <lluoc> that would be hilarious and explotable[0m
2012-04-03 10:12:00 [INFO] <H4ZM4T> mhmm[0m

2012-04-15 10:29:44 [INFO] <lluoc> Because say it was left on xp grind and you need to kill them all[0m
2012-04-15 10:29:53 [INFO] <lluoc> say becuse they are making lag[0m
2012-04-15 10:29:56 [INFO] <lluoc> then this should do it[0m
2012-04-15 10:30:04 [INFO] <lluoc> there will be no where for them to go[0m
2012-04-15 10:30:18 [INFO] <nightkhaos> but them dieing sloves the problem just the same[0m
2012-04-15 10:30:20 [INFO] <lluoc> also the drop damage might still get them[0m
2012-04-15 10:30:41 [INFO] <lluoc> it does. but say there are 500 and you can parely move and more and more keep spawning[0m
2012-04-15 10:30:46 [INFO] <lluoc> then you need to kill them all[0m
2012-04-15 10:31:09 [INFO] <lluoc> the next method would be 2 layers. one to have a kill platform and the other as a[0m

2012-04-15 10:31:27 [INFO] <lluoc> require double the pistons though[0m
2012-04-15 10:32:01 [INFO] <lluoc> honestly I would prefer the void solution[0m
2012-04-15 10:32:07 [INFO] <nightkhaos> think you can implement it?[0m
2012-04-15 10:32:20 [INFO] <lluoc> if i can get the pistons. probably[0m
2012-04-15 10:32:29 [INFO] <lluoc> need to see how much space i have to work with though[0m
2012-04-15 10:32:47 [INFO] <nightkhaos> pistons aren't the problem anymore, we can manufature those pretty easily... slime is[0m
2012-04-15 10:32:56 [INFO] <lluoc> that's what i meant[0m
2012-04-15 10:33:37 [INFO] <lluoc> hmm.[0m
2012-04-15 10:33:56 [INFO] <nightkhaos> the only way this will lag is if some idoit levels the enderman spawning rather than dieing[0m
2012-04-15 10:34:11 [INFO] <lluoc> which can and probabl will happen[0m
2012-04-15 10:34:25 [INFO] <lluoc> then i have to work out some way of killing all the enderman here via the server[0m
2012-04-15 10:34:28 [INFO] <lluoc> console[0m
2012-04-15 10:34:46 [INFO] <nightkhaos> actually I have a better idea.[0m
2012-04-15 10:34:56 [INFO] <lluoc> ?[0m
2012-04-15 10:35:18 [INFO] <nightkhaos> when they leave the area via the rail they will activate a dector rail that will reset the pistons[0m
2012-04-15 10:35:44 [INFO] <lluoc> ahh... unless two people leave or someone is afk for a long time[0m
2012-04-15 10:36:14 [INFO] <nightkhaos> no, it'll be a flip flop... leaving ALWAYS sets it to death mode[0m
2012-04-15 10:36:34 [INFO] <lluoc> won't change those still in the trap though[0m
2012-04-15 10:36:41 [INFO] <lluoc> though it would help[0m
2012-04-15 10:37:14 [INFO] <nightkhaos> this is true... unless upon death mode we release a damage potion into the area.[0m
2012-04-15 10:37:33 [INFO] <lluoc> requires scripts to maintain it[0m
2012-04-15 10:38:00 [INFO] <nightkhaos> no... that I can do with redstone as well and dispensors... the problem is keeping the dispensers[0m
2012-04-15 10:38:02 [INFO] <nightkhaos> full[0m
2012-04-15 10:38:22 [INFO] <lluoc> even then. Plus they could be taken[0m

2012-04-15 10:38:53 [INFO] <lluoc> let me se if i can actually do this[0m
2012-04-15 10:39:03 [INFO] <nightkhaos> so one potion doing one heart of damage is enough[0m
2012-04-15 10:39:15 [INFO] <lluoc> but void death seems like the most reliable method of killing them all[0m
2012-04-15 10:39:55 [INFO] <lluoc> And it is keeping the despencsers full that worries me[0m
2012-04-15 10:40:14 [INFO] <lluoc> Also, doesnt the void potion seem more... elogant?[0m
2012-04-15 10:40:29 [INFO] <nightkhaos> void will be more reliable[0m

2012-04-15 10:44:48 [INFO] <nightkhaos> might be easy[0m
2012-04-15 10:44:54 [INFO] <lluoc> less fun though[0m
2012-04-15 10:45:01 [INFO] <lluoc> and require the same numer of pistons[0m
2012-04-15 10:45:07 [INFO] <lluoc> and would probably be uglyer[0m
2012-04-15 10:45:18 [INFO] <lluoc> as it would need to be above the kill platform[0m
2012-04-15 10:47:21 [INFO] <nightkhaos> actually won't the void option require 3x the pistons?[0m
2012-04-15 10:47:28 [INFO] <lluoc> why?[0m
2012-04-15 10:48:02 [INFO] <nightkhaos> ahh I see[0m

2012-04-15 10:50:38 [INFO] <nightkhaos> we can use standard pistons for the crush option[0m
2012-04-15 10:51:09 [INFO] <lluoc> looks less pretty. We could use standard pistons for the kill platorm now[0m

2012-04-15 10:51:19 [INFO] <lluoc> also, done[0m

2012-04-23 21:20:13 [INFO] <The_Whistler> who do you mainly play?[0m
2012-04-23 21:20:20 [INFO] <The_Whistler> oh and someone just added me so I was confused[0m
2012-04-23 21:20:55 [INFO] <ozymandias12345> right i've played a few games with master yi but im rather bad[0m
2012-04-23 21:25:38 [INFO] <The_Whistler> master yi is hard.[0m
2012-04-23 21:25:42 [INFO] <The_Whistler> so don't get yourself down[0m
2012-04-23 21:25:48 [INFO] <The_Whistler> it's all about learning to farm[0m
2012-04-23 21:25:52 [INFO] <The_Whistler> once you learn that[0m
2012-04-23 21:25:56 [INFO] <The_Whistler> you can own any game[0m
2012-04-23 21:26:10 [INFO] <The_Whistler> but laning is the most important part, I am good at teamfights, but laning.. not so[0m
2012-04-23 21:26:43 [INFO] <ozymandias12345> yeh i dont know why ethen suggested master yi, i proably should have gone for a ranged champ[0m
2012-04-23 21:27:03 [INFO] <The_Whistler> AD ranged is the hardest to play.[0m
2012-04-23 21:27:15 [INFO] <The_Whistler> because you need all the farm.[0m
2012-04-23 21:27:31 [INFO] <ozymandias12345> but it seems so much safer[0m
2012-04-23 21:27:38 [INFO] <The_Whistler> support is easy, tank is simple once you know about the damage ratios. AP is difficult and jungle is[0m
2012-04-23 21:27:42 [INFO] <The_Whistler> the hardest.[0m
2012-04-23 21:27:49 [INFO] <ozymandias12345> right[0m
2012-04-23 21:28:04 [INFO] <The_Whistler> AD and AP carry are the hardest. I would suggest someone like Annie. because she's a basic mage[0m
2012-04-23 21:28:09 [INFO] <The_Whistler> and she is good at what she does.[0m
2012-04-23 21:28:35 [INFO] <The_Whistler> if you really wanna AD, then go with someone like Yi, but try and play smart.[0m
2012-04-23 21:28:45 [INFO] <ozymandias12345> i also had to purchase a cheap champ and to be fair master yi is fun to play[0m
2012-04-23 21:29:01 [INFO] <The_Whistler> most AD characters that aren't ranged go top lane.[0m
2012-04-23 21:29:07 [INFO] <The_Whistler> with the ranged on bot lane.[0m
2012-04-23 21:29:26 [INFO] <The_Whistler> at top you want to be tanky and have a good poke.[0m
2012-04-23 21:29:27 [INFO] <ozymandias12345> also playing it AP with him was kinda hillarious[0m
2012-04-23 21:29:39 [INFO] <The_Whistler> yi has not much of either, and his sustain isn't very good.[0m
2012-04-23 21:31:40 [INFO] <ozymandias12345> also who is a good tank[0m
2012-04-23 21:32:01 [INFO] <The_Whistler> it varies. most tanks end up in the jungle these days[0m
2012-04-23 21:32:11 [INFO] <The_Whistler> so Shen, Rammus,[0m
2012-04-23 21:32:15 [INFO] <The_Whistler> Galio,[0m
2012-04-23 21:32:26 [INFO] <The_Whistler> tanks will either end up supporting or jungling.[0m
